## Features 

> [!NOTE]
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` represent parameters that must be provided by the user. <br>
    e.g. in `view-patient NRIC`, `NRIC` is a parameter which can be used as `view-patient S1234567D`.
> - Items in square brackets are optional. <br>
    e.g. `ic/NRIC [n/NAME] [dob/BIRTHDATE]` can be used as `ic/S1234567D n/John` or as `ic/S1234567D dob/2002-06-07`.
> - Every parameter must be supplied by the user. <br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `add-appointment ic/NRIC dt/DATE t/TIME dsc/DESCRIPTION`, the user
    must fill in all parameters for the input to be valid.
> - Parameters could be entered in any order. <br>
    e.g. if the command recommends `ic/NRIC dt/DATE t/TIME dsc/DESCRIPTION`, the user
    can also not follow this exact sequence for the input to be valid.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored. <br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `list-patient 12345`, it will be interpreted as `list-patient`.
> - Command words are **case-insensitive**. <br>
    e.g. `liST-paTIEnt` will be interpreted as `list-patient`.
